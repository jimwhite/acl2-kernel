    "We assume you have taken the Flying Tour but that you did not necessarily follow all the “off-tour” links because we encouraged you not to. With the Walking Tour we encourage you to visit off-tour links — provided they are not marked with the tiny warning sign (\\*).

    "\n",
    "The logic of ACL2 is based on Common Lisp.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common Lisp is the standard list processing programming language. It is documented in: Guy L. Steele, [Common Lisp The Language](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/Groups/AI/html/cltl/cltl2.html), Digital Press, 12 Crosby Drive, Bedford, MA 01730, 1990.\n",
    "\n",
    "ACL2 formalizes only a subset of Common Lisp. It includes such familiar Lisp functions as cons, car and cdr for creating and manipulating list structures, various arithmetic primitives such as `+`, `*`, expt and `<=`, and intern and `symbol-name` for creating and manipulating symbols. Control primitives include `cond`, `case` and `if`, as well as function call, including recursion. New functions are defined with `defun` and macros with `defmacro`. See [programming](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/v8-3/combined-manual/index.html?topic=ACL2____PROGRAMMING)\\* for a list of the Common Lisp primitives supported by ACL2.\n",
    "\n",
    "ACL2 supports five of Common Lisp’s datatypes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* the precisely represented, unbounded numbers (integers, rationals, and the complex numbers with rational components, called the “complex rationals” here),\n",
    "\n",
    "* the characters with ASCII codes between 0 and 255\n",
    "\n",
    "* strings of such characters\n",
    "\n",
    "* symbols (including packages)\n",
    "\n",
    "* conses\n",
    "\n",
    "ACL2 is a very small subset of full Common Lisp. ACL2 does not include the Common Lisp Object System (CLOS), higher order functions, circular structures, and other aspects of Common Lisp that are **non-applicative**. Roughly speaking, a language is applicative if it follows the rules of function application. For example, `f(x)` must be equal to `f(x)`, which means, among other things, that the value of `f` must not be affected by “global variables” and the object `x` must not change over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## An Example Common Lisp Function Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the binary trees `x` and `y` below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/v8-3/combined-manual/res/tours/binary-trees-x-y.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "In Lisp, `x` is written as the list `'(A B)` or, equivalently, as `'(A B . NIL)`. Similarly, `y` may be written `'(C D E)`. Suppose we wish to replace the right-most tip of `x` by the entire tree `y`. This is denoted `(app x y)`, where `app` stands for \"append\".\n",
    "\n",
    "![](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/v8-3/combined-manual/res/tours/binary-trees-app.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "We can define `app` with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```lisp\n",
    "(defun app (x y)                           ; Concatenate x and y. \n",
    "  (declare (type (satisfies true-listp) x)); We expect x to end in NIL. \n",
    "  (cond ((endp x) y)                       ; If x is empty, return y. \n",
    "        (t (cons (car x)                   ; Else, copy first node \n",
    "                 (app (cdr x) y)))))       ;  and recur into next. \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you defined this function in some Common Lisp, then to run app the `x` and `y` above you could then type\n",
    "\n",
    "```lisp\n",
    "(app '(A B) '(C D E))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "and Common Lisp will print the `(A B C D E)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## An Example of ACL2 in Use\n",
    "\n",
    "To introduce you to ACL2 we will consider the app function discussed in the Common Lisp page, **except** we will omit for the moment the **declare** form, which in ACL2 is called a **guard**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Guards are arbitrary ACL2 terms that express the “intended domain” of functions. In that sense, guards are akin to type signatures. However, Common Lisp and ACL2 are untyped programming languages: while the language supports several different data types and the types of objects can be determined by predicates at runtime, any type of object may be passed to any function. Thus, guards are “extra-logical.” Recognizing both the practical and intellectual value of knowing that your functions are applied to the kinds of objects you intend, ACL2 imposes guards on Common Lisp and provides a means of proving that functions are used as intended. But the story is necessarily complicated and we do not recommend it to the new user. Get used to the fact that any ACL2 function may be applied to any objects and program accordingly. Read about guards later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the definition again\n",
    "\n",
    "```lisp\n",
    "(defun app (x y) \n",
    "  (cond ((endp x) y) \n",
    "        (t (cons (car x)  \n",
    "                 (app (cdr x) y))))) \n",

    "- how ACL2 proves the theorem, and\n",
    "- how that theorem can be used in another proof.\n",
    "\n",
    "Along the way we will talk about the **definitional principle**, **types**, the ACL2 **read-eval-print loop**, and how the **theorem prover** works.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we complete this part of the tour we will return briefly to the notion of **guard** and revisit several of the topics above in that context.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How To Find Out about ACL2 Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Most ACL2 primitives are documented. Here is the definition of `app` again, with the documented topics higlighted. \\* All of the links below lead into the ACL2 User's Manual. So follow these links if you with, but use your Back Button to return here!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```lisp\n",
    "(defun app (x y) \n",
    "  (cond ((endp x) y) \n",
    "        (t (cons (car x)  \n",
    "                 (app (cdr x) y))))) \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "By following the link on [`endp`\\*](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/v8-3/combined-manual/index.html?topic=COMMON-LISP____ENDP) we see that it is a Common Lisp function and is defined to be the same as [`atom`\\*](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/v8-3/combined-manual/index.html?topic=COMMON-LISP____ATOM), which recognizes non-conses. But `endp` has a guard. Since we are ignoring guards for now, we'll ignore the guard issue on `endp`.\n",
    "\n",
    "So this definition reads \"to `app x` and `y`: if `x` is an atom, return `y`; otherwise, `app (cdr x)` and `y` and then cons `(car x)` onto that.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## How To Find Out about ACL2 Functions (cont)\n",
    "\n",
    "The ACL2 documentation is also available in Emacs, via the ACL2-Doc browser (see [ACL2-Doc](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/v8-3/combined-manual/index.html?topic=ACL2____ACL2-DOC))\\* , allowing you to explore the hyperlinked documentation in the comfort of a text editor that can also interact with ACL2.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, runtime images of ACL2 have the hyperlinked text as a large ACL2 data structure that can be explored with ACL2’s `:doc` command. If you have ACL2 running, try the command `:doc endp`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to find out about ACL2 functions, if you have an ACL2 image available, is to use the command [`:args`\\*](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/v8-3/combined-manual/index.html?topic=ACL2____ARGS)  which prints the formals, type, and guard of a function symbol.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, the ACL2 documentation can also be printed out as a very long book but we do not recommend that! See the ACL2 Home Page to download the Postscript.\n",

Instead, they look at certain subgoals printed in failed proofs, figure whether and how those subgoals can be proved, and give ACL2 directions for proving them, usually by simply proving other lemmas. Furthermore, to be a good user of ACL2 you do not have to understand how the theorem prover works. You just have to understand how to interact with it. We explain this in great detail later.
